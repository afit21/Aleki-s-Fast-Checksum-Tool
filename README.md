AFCT - Aleki's Fast Checksum Tool

Quickly and easily calculate the Checksum of a single file, or 1000's of files.
Supported Checksum's incude: SHA1, MD5, SHA256, and SHA512.

This program uses Multithreading to calculate Checksums in parallel. The main class, 'MultithreadingChecksumCommands.cs' has comments throughout the code and is fairly easy to ead through if you would like to use the class for a feature in your own project.

Feel free to use my code in your projects or compile your own versions of my program! the 'MultithreadingChecksumCommands.cs' class may save some time in your own project.

- Support to run from a CMD or Powershell comming in the future!
